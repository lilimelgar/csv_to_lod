# image-transcript_alignment_to_lod
This repository stores the code and (sample) data necessary to convert a csv file with image/scans and its transcripts to RDF.

It is mostly an exercise to learn how to convert a csv to LOD following these steps: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43524943/creating-rdf-file-using-csv-file-as-input/61445967#61445967. The purpose is to apply this code to update the data story here: https://iisg.amsterdam/en/data/data-websites/lippische-ziegler to grab the updated data (more transcripts added) from Dataverse, here: (pending to upload)
