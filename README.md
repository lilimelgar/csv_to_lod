# Converting csv files to linked data

This repository stores the code and (sample) data necessary to convert a csv file to RDF.

It is mostly an exercise to learn how to convert a csv to LOD following the steps in this tutorial: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43524943/creating-rdf-file-using-csv-file-as-input/61445967#61445967. 

Besides learning, the main purpose is to apply this code to update the data of the "Lippe brick-makers project" of the International Institute of Social History stored here: https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/dataverse/lippe.
